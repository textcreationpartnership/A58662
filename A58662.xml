            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the sad and dangerous condition wherein this Kirk and Kingdom is now cast, by the publick Resolutions and practises of these who have inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in War against the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> do proclaim unto all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Religion and the Countrey, what is needfull to be done in this day of distresse: Yet for the better information of the Lords people, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it necessary, shortly for the present to declare what we hold incumbent in duty to all these who would not betray the cause of God, and render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves slaves to the Tyrannie and lust of ungodly and Malignant men, hoping in a short time to make known our thoughts of these particulars more fully.</p>
            <p>When the dis-affected and prevailing party in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of this Kingdom did manifest head-strong reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to make War upon <hi>England,</hi> under a pretext of suppressing Sectaries, But in effect, to dissolve the union
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101207:3"/>betwixt the Kingdoms, and to restore the King to the exercise of his Arbitrary Government, and make way for promoving of the Designes of the Malignant party in both Nations: just and necessary desires relating unto the grounds of an ingagement, and unto the securing of Religion, were presented unto their Lordships by the Commission of the former Generall Assembly; But these desires were altogether slighted, and an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment resolved upon such grounds as are contrary to the Word of God, and do infer the breach of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Solemn League and Covenant, as is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden forth in the Declaration of the last Generall Assembly; wherein also may be seen the great incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are made upon the Liberties of the Kirk: Neither was there any regard had unto the dissent and Protestation of a considerable number of Members of Parliament, who had been most active and streight in the Cause from the beginning; nor unto the Petitions and Supplications of many Synods and Presbyteries, and of the wel-affected people of the Land, who were seeking satisfaction to their consciences: But instead of a satisfactory answer, the ingagement whilk was wickedly resolved, was violently carried on by most strange plundering and cruell oppression, especially of these who did declare it upon no other ground then out of fear to sin against God: And as though it had been too little to force obedience unto their unlawfull Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Acts, the Committee of Estates have urged and pressed the subscribing of a Band and Declaration of Parliament, wherein men are obliged to acknowledge the justice &amp; equity of all the Acts, Conclusions &amp; Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101207:3"/>thereof, or if they refuse, are to be esteemed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Religion &amp; their Country; And after that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes of Estates had sent such an Army unto <hi>England,</hi> as by the borders thereof, was professed to be so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as was sufficient to prosecute their resolutions in that Kingdome, without any further supply of forces from this, yet they have resolved upon, and prosecuted a new levie, with no lesse violence, then the former that they may wreith the yoke of their oppression upon the necks of the Lords people, and bring the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in slavery and bondage. And though the Lord hath declared his wrath from heaven against these their resolutions and proceedings, by bringing their Army to so sudden and shamefull an overthrow; Yet do they still adhere unto, and persue the same designes, and have not onely brought within the bowells of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the remnant of that godlesse and prophane Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but have given Comission also to classed incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Rebels who served under the conduct of <hi>James Grahame</hi> to raise forces, and by the whole tenour of their carriage, do make it appear to all who have eyes to see: that they do intend the rather to involve the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in blood, then to be restrained in the persuite of their former wicked resolutions.</p>
            <p>Therefore albeit the thoughts of peace be pretious unto us, and that we wish and exhort every one to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Peace with all men, as much as is possible; Yet looking upon the eminent dangers that threaten Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the grievous oppressions that lies upon the Lords people in their consciences, persons, and estates, and the many fearfull evils, that threatens both Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101207:4"/>if the remnant of these mens wrath be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained; We conceive that all the people of God are obliged and ingaged by Covenant, with their lives and estates, to endeavour and persue these following ends, and to oppose all the enemies and adversaries thereof; 1. Because Religion is of all things the most excellent &amp; precious, the securing thereof is to be most in our thoughts, and in the endeavours of all men, that it may be preserved unto us, &amp; transmitted unto our posteritie, in puritie. Secondly, All are bound to defend and maintain the liberties of the Kirk, which is the house of God, and the ground and pillar of truth. Thirdly, all are bound to vindicate the liberties of the subjects, in all these things which concern their consciences, persons, and estates. Fourthly, there is no lesse obligation, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to maintain the union betwixt the Kingdomes, and to avoid every thing that may weaken the same, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us in any measure of accession unto the guilt of these who have invaded the Kingdome of England. Fifthly, all are to indeavour the Kings Majesties resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to the exercise of his Royall power, as soon as he shall give security for Religion, in the manner expressed in the desires of the late Comission of the Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things as are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the peace and safety of the Kingdom. Sixthly, all are to take a more effectual course then heretofore for punishing and suppressing of all Malignancy, injustice, iniquity, prophanenesse and impiety, and to endeavour, that the best and fittest remedie's be applied for taking away the causes of these evils, and advancing Religion and Righteousnesse in the Land, and that those men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101207:4"/>who have been formerly instrumentall in our present miseries and calamities be not again admitted unto any such trust or power as may enable them to involve the Land in the same or the like evils.</p>
            <p>These things are of such importance and consequence as that we know not what can be expected without them but a continuance and increase of our present mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and calamities; And therefore seeing the Lord hath now put into the hands of his people such an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and made many willing in this day of his power. We do exhort and beseech all men throughout the land by the mercies of God who hath not given us over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, but left us a naill in his holy place, that they would seriously mind, and to the utmost of their power prefer these ends against all lets and impediments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and oppose all these who stand for the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the beginning of this work the Lord stirred up the spirits of his people to joyne together and defend themselves against tyranny and oppression in these things which concerned their consciences and liberties; and albeit their power was but small, and the strength of adversaries great, yet because they did their duty in the simplicity of their hearts, and trusted in the name of the Lord, he was pleased to make the enemies melt as wax before the fire, and to vanish as smoke before the wind: And if after so many rich experiences of his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and rare testimonies of his loving kindnesse, and great deliverances out of trubles and solemne ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by vows and Covenants, we should sit still, or comply with those who have carried on the ingagement in a time that threatens so much danger unto Religion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101207:5"/>and so iminent ruins to our liberties, persons, and estates, we could not but be exceedingly guilty before the Lord, and deserve to be plagued as betrayers of the cause of God, and of the safety both of Kirk and State: Let us therefore arise, and do our duty, and the Lord of hosts who hath alreadie broken the power, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
